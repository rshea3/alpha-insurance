You have been hired by Alpha Insurance to develop predictive models to determine which automobile claims are fraudulent. You have been given data on approximately 5000 auto claims which includes a variable indicating whether the company believes the claim is fraudulent or not.

 ## Hypothesis
 These variables appear to be the best for detecting fraudulent claims: 
 * Claim Amount - Uncommonly high claim amounts are more likely to be fraudulent.
 * Claim Cause - The more severe claim causes (fire and collision) will be less likely to be fraudulent.
 * Claim Report Type - Fraud claims will be reported with as little human interaction as possible.
 * Employment Status - Claimants who are not currently employed are more likely to report fraudulent claims.
 * Income - The higher the level of education, the less likely reports are to be fraudulent. (This may also be linked with income)
